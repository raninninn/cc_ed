# cc_ed
## Description
cc_ed is an editor for the Minecraft mod [Computercraft](www.computercraft.info), aiming to replicate the workings of the standard editor, ed.
_cc_ed uses [Lua patterns](https://www.lua.org/pil/20.2.html) for regex._

## What works so far:
- All line addressing modes
- n and p
- Appending `a`, inserting `i`, changing `c` and deleting `d` lines
- `s` (although it needs some polishing)
- Toggling error messages with `H`
- Turning syntax highlighting on and off with `set syntaxHL = true/false`
