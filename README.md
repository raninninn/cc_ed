# cc_ed
## Description
cc_ed is an editor for the Minecraft mod [Computercraft](www.computercraft.info), aiming to replicate the workings of the standard editor, ed.

## What works so far:
- Loading and saving files
- Most line addressing modes
- n and p
- Appending `a`, inserting `i`, changing `c` and deleting `d` lines
