# cc_ed
## Description
cc_ed is an editor for the Minecraft mod [Computercraft](www.computercraft.info), aiming to replicate the workings of the standard editor, ed.

## What works so far:
- Loading and saving files
- All line addressing modes that don't require regex
- n and p
- Appending `a`, inserting `i`, changing `c` and deleting `d` lines 
- Toggling error messages with `H`
- Turning syntax highlighting on and off with `set syntaxHL = true/false`
